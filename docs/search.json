    "section": "Origins",
    "text": "Origins\nThe PSInet idea represents a convergence of prior initiatives linked by their focus on network-enabled and/or global-scale understanding of ecosystem water status and flows. The first call from a water potential network may be traced to at 2012 American Geophysical Union presentation by PSInet Steering Committee member George Koch, which coincided with the publication of the first iteration of the Xylem Functional Traits (XFT) database. Since then, the SAPFLUXNET network was conceived and built, and flux tower networks have grown larger and become more open.\nThe last decade has seen an explosion of interest in using plant hydraulic concepts to address pressing eco-physiological research questions.However, a centralized repository for water potential time series, which are critical for connecting meteorological drivers to plant responses, does not yet exist. The need for such a database was again raised at the 2020 Ecological Society of America (ESA) meeting, where several team members (Guo, Novick, Kannenberg) convened the session “Plant Water Use Strategies in a Changing World.” The journal Functional Ecology invited the session organizers and speakers to prepare a review article on the topic which proposes that fully characterizing plant drought responses “require[s] water potential datasets of greater quantity and quality to pair with flux measurements, model output, and remote sensing approaches.”\nAt the same time, interest has been growing in the potential to use remotely-sensed vegetation optical depth data as a proxy for ecosystem water content and potential at continental and global scales. However, this research priority requires a centralized network of in-situ water potential observations for algorithm development and benchmarking. The emergence of psychrometers and other methodologies as tools for continuous monitoring of in-situ plant water potential has revealed a clear need for community-developed best practices and standards for deploying these instruments. Finally, there is a growing appreciation of the value of collecting, and aggregating, information on soil water potential (and its relationship with soil moisture content) in ecological field research settings, which is already being addressed to some extent by activities born out of the AmeriFlux “Year of Water” initiative (including the deployment of in-situ matric potential sensors at AmeriFlux sites, and a systematic effort to generate laboratory-derived water retention curves).\nWith support from this RCN, we can grow these individual efforts into a much larger global database that also includes continuous plant Ψ timeseries, and with links to data across multiple networks. This RCN will also provide diverse networking and training opportunities through collaborations with multiple established workshops and short-courses, including PhysFest, the Summer Workshop in Plant Hydraulic Techniques, and FluxCourse. Thus, our network design brings together many ongoing but thus-far disjunct and incomplete activities into a broader vision for a global plant water potential network and associated Community of Practice."

    "text": "Figure 1: George and I installing some stem psychrometers at Bradshaw Ranch, AZ. Photo credit Ben Umali\nWhen I was on the academic job market, I pared back my teaching philosophy to something simple and not at all original: students learn by doing. This last week, while spending time with my former advisor George Koch (NAU) and Ben Umali (ICT International), I was reminded of why that simple mantra is so effective. Although emails and zoom calls are helpful, there was simply no replacement for watching Ben and George, asking questions in real time, and practicing the installations myself.\nI have been successful with psychrometers so far, thanks to George’s lessons of almost 10 years ago. However, Ben shared a new method that limits xylem exposure, which likely increases the longevity of the installation. Using a flat razor blade, he makes initial transverse cuts spanning the diameter of the sensor head, which limits the width of the exposed xylem. After tangential cutting that exposes the different layers (outer bark, inner bark, phloem, cambium), Ben limits his motions to scraping, which minimizes over-cutting and ensures a flat surface for sensor attachment.\nIndeed, if the sensor loses contact with the xylem, the same installation site could be reused by re-scraping the xylem, rather than creating an additional wound elsewhere. I wish I’d known this method 3 years ago when working on sagebrush, which had highly irregular xylem!\nBut the information exchange was not unidirectional. George pioneered the use of self-adhesive silicone tape1 to attach the sensor to the stem, which provides both security and a vapor seal, replacing the need for vacuum grease. Ben still advises a minute application of vacuum grease, but he seemed excited to include silicone tape in future installation guidelines. It was a fantastic opportunity to learn by doing, while surrounded by the beauty of Northern Arizona."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Figure 1: ERI results from Panama highlighting the changes in soil water content based on soil conductance will be used to expand the spatial understanding of bulk and root-zone soil water potential. Data and figure credit Daniel Beverly\n\n\nMy Ph.D. at the University of Wyoming through the Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCHEG) afforded me a unique opportunity to mix hydrological, geophysical, and ecophysiological approaches to track water movement. Our extensive interdisciplinary team aimed to close the water budget using interpolations of snow distributions, measures of whole-tree and understory evapotranspiration, and a unique implementation of near-surface geophysical observations illuminating the subsurface hydrological fluxes. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) techniques have produced continuous observations of subsurface processes for parsing subsurface flows, vertical infiltration, and water uptake within the rooting zones. However, I believe this is just the forefront of using near-surface geophysical tools for exploring the rhizosphere and rooting-zone hydraulic mechanisms controlling carbon and water fluxes.\nThe world of plant water relations is theoretically rich with biophysical processes but often lacks empirical observations needed to test these mechanisms. A substantial gap emerges from the temporal and spatial mismatch in data collection of water potentials. Namely, leaf water potentials are typically measured once or twice a day (e.g., predawn and midday), at weekly to monthly sampling intervals, and on individuals distributed across the landscape. Soil water potential is rarely measured in situ; instead, estimates are predicted by models parameterized with soil volumetric water content and soil characteristics. Soil water contents are often recorded every 5 to 30 minutes, but only from a limited number of landscape positions. In sum, plant water potentials are mostly discrete in time but replicated spatially, while soil water potentials are mostly discrete in space but temporally continuous.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The temporal-spatial mismatch across the water potential (Ψ) measurement space from soils (ΨS; light blue), xylem (ΨX; dark blue), and leaves (ΨL; green) limit confident predictions of Ψ gradients. The electrical resistivity imaging (ERI; burgundy) reduces this mismatch by expanding the spatial representation of ΨS to maximize the overlap with ΨL. Figure credit Daniel Beverly\n\n\nElectrical resistivity imaging (ERI) is a promising approach to fill gaps in the spatial-temporal mismatch for soil water potential measurements. Specifically, this technique expands spatial representation by covering more rooting and soil area while maintaining high temporal resolution. Repeated pulses of electrical current provide a time series of 2-D maps, capturing the subtle variations in soil, bedrock, and water content. Soil moisture can be confidently estimated as a function of electrical conductance.\nOur work in Panama was successful in differentiating the soil-surface evaporation and the depletion of soil moisture within the root zone. However, while ERI is typically used to monitor volumetric changes in soil water, it is rarely used to estimate the spatial-temporal dynamics of soil water potential. Since soil conductance and soil water potential are equally sensitive to changes in soil particle size, pH, salinity, cation exchange capacity, and porosity, ERI may be an even better proxy for soil water potential than water content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Electrodes associated with ERI transect running through a forest in southeastern Wyoming. Photo credit Daniel Beverly\n\n\nWith my newly funded USDA NIFA project, I am excited to explore the ability of the ERI techniques to characterize the rhizosphere and rooting zone soil water potentials. This project focuses on understanding the seasonal variation in rooting zone water potentials in hardwood forests of Indiana and Michigan, along with the evaluation of soil hydraulics differences among cover cropping strategies, both of which are important carbon sinks throughout the Midwest. We are hoping that these data will provide better constraints on the rooting processes that are doing to be essential for predicting future carbon sequestration and drought responses."

    "title": "Harmonizing global water stress research",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the dynamic world of ecosystems, water plays a central role. The sensitivity of vegetation to drought, especially, hinges upon understanding water limitation. However, in trying to unravel this complex relationship, the scientific community has often been hamstrung by the immense variety of vegetation types, different climates, and the unpredictability of root zones. Our recent study in New Phytologist, titled Diagnosing evapotranspiration responses to water deficit across biomes using deep learning, sheds light on some of these open questions, but it also highlights where the knowledge gaps remain.\nBy employing deep neural networks, we’ve taken a closer look at how vegetation responds when faced with drought conditions. We’ve been able to isolate and measure a water stress factor (fET) that indicates evapotranspiration (ET) reductions during drought. Notably, our results have shown varying ET responses to water stress. From the rapid decline of fET in some savannah and grassland sites to the subtle reduction in most forests, the range is broad. But here’s the catch: in most arid sites, after an initial drop, the relationship between fET and the cumulative water deficit seems to level off (Figure 1). But why?\nWhen initially presented with these findings, we wrestled with the question: was this due to increased xylem resistance at these sites, or could these locations access deeper underground water reserves? The answer, or at least a part of it, was found in previous field studies. These studies revealed that vegetation, especially in drier areas, can sustain ET during drought due to groundwater or deeper soil moisture access. At the same time, plants also strategically adjust their stomatal closure based on the progression of water deficits. However, many conventional land surface models don’t account for these intricacies, leading to an incomplete understanding of water stress and its impacts.\nAnd this brings us to a critical gap. Despite their undeniable importance, field studies and measurements, particularly those focusing on water potential (Figure 2), are not easily accessible and not commonly co-located with ecosystem-scale measurements. This lack of data poses challenges for researchers aiming to refine global understanding of water limitation in terrestrial ecosystems.\nImagine the breakthroughs possible if researchers had access to a standardised and comprehensive database of water potential measurements across various biomes! Our exploration into ET responses to drought using deep learning has shown promising results. But the road ahead requires collaboration, shared resources, and a concerted effort to fill the data gaps. The scientific community would greatly benefit from a global network of water potential measurements, giving us the tools to better understand our planet’s ecosystems.
