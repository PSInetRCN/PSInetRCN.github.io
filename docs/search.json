    "text": "Figure 1: Field installation of Florapulse sensors.\n\n\n\nMeasuring tree water potentials has traditionally been a pain... Picture this: climbing trees, digging up roots – basically, a full workout just to get to the right spot. And that’s just the warm-up! Then you need to either have your pressure chamber in the field, or you need to pack your sampling material safely and bring it to the lab in a timely manner. Oh, and did I mention the early wake-up calls to get pre-dawn water potentials and the hustle until the afternoon? All that effort just for two data points! So, you can imagine the excitement when we stumbled upon a way to measure stem water potentials continuously, without breaking the bank.\nWe obtained some Florapulse sensors and decided to give them a go in a nature reserve in central Germany. We installed them in Fagus sylvatica and Fraxinus excelsior trees. The sensor works similarly to other tensiometers but in reduced format within xylem tissue – it equilibrates between a sample of interest and an internal volume of liquid water. Setting it up was easy enough, taking only about 15 minutes per tree (Figure 1, Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Microtensiometer installed in a beech tree\n\n\n\nBut of course, nothing is that easy – the readings we initially got were just confusing. Turns out, these sensors don’t run at all on a multiplexer, so we had to shuffle things around and run them directly on the logger. Once we sorted that out, the data started making sense, and we could finally breathe easy (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Daily stem water potential cycles in a beech tree in July 2023, as measured by a Florapulse sensor.\n\n\n\nJust when we thought we had it all figured out, summer rain threw us a curveball. The data got wonky again, leading to a series of back-and-forth trips between the lab and the field. We played detective, checking sensor functionality in the lab and trekking back to the trees for reinstallations, but the data quality remained a bit of a head-scratcher (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Daily stem water potential cycles in a beech tree after some rain showers in early August 2023, as measured by a Florapulse sensor.\n\n\n\nIn parallel, we decided to compare sensor output with leaf water potential measured by the pressure chamber. We installed two sensors in Fagus sylvatica and Carpinus betulus trees close to the lab and were relieved that they seemed to agree well (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Correlation between leaf water potential (pressure chamber) and stem water potential (Florapulse sensors) in F. sylvatica (beech) and C. betulus (hornbeam).\n\n\n\nNow, there’s a ton of data analysis waiting for us, but looking back at the quirks and challenges, we’re excited to dive back in next year. Our big plan? Integrate stem and soil water potential measurements to understand flow dynamics during the growing season."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the dynamic world of ecosystems, water plays a central role. The sensitivity of vegetation to drought, especially, hinges upon understanding water limitation. However, in trying to unravel this complex relationship, the scientific community has often been hamstrung by the immense variety of vegetation types, different climates, and the unpredictability of root zones. Our recent study in New Phytologist, titled Diagnosing evapotranspiration responses to water deficit across biomes using deep learning, sheds light on some of these open questions, but it also highlights where the knowledge gaps remain.\nBy employing deep neural networks, we’ve taken a closer look at how vegetation responds when faced with drought conditions. We’ve been able to isolate and measure a water stress factor (fET) that indicates evapotranspiration (ET) reductions during drought. Notably, our results have shown varying ET responses to water stress. From the rapid decline of fET in some savannah and grassland sites to the subtle reduction in most forests, the range is broad. But here’s the catch: in most arid sites, after an initial drop, the relationship between fET and the cumulative water deficit seems to level off (Figure 1). But why?\nWhen initially presented with these findings, we wrestled with the question: was this due to increased xylem resistance at these sites, or could these locations access deeper underground water reserves? The answer, or at least a part of it, was found in previous field studies. These studies revealed that vegetation, especially in drier areas, can sustain ET during drought due to groundwater or deeper soil moisture access. At the same time, plants also strategically adjust their stomatal closure based on the progression of water deficits. However, many conventional land surface models don’t account for these intricacies, leading to an incomplete understanding of water stress and its impacts.\nAnd this brings us to a critical gap. Despite their undeniable importance, field studies and measurements, particularly those focusing on water potential (Figure 2), are not easily accessible and not commonly co-located with ecosystem-scale measurements. This lack of data poses challenges for researchers aiming to refine global understanding of water limitation in terrestrial ecosystems.\nImagine the breakthroughs possible if researchers had access to a standardised and comprehensive database of water potential measurements across various biomes! Our exploration into ET responses to drought using deep learning has shown promising results. But the road ahead requires collaboration, shared resources, and a concerted effort to fill the data gaps. The scientific community would greatly benefit from a global network of water potential measurements, giving us the tools to better understand our planet’s ecosystems.

    "text": "Figure 1: George and I installing some stem psychrometers at Bradshaw Ranch, AZ. Photo credit Ben Umali\nWhen I was on the academic job market, I pared back my teaching philosophy to something simple and not at all original: students learn by doing. This last week, while spending time with my former advisor George Koch (NAU) and Ben Umali (ICT International), I was reminded of why that simple mantra is so effective. Although emails and zoom calls are helpful, there was simply no replacement for watching Ben and George, asking questions in real time, and practicing the installations myself.\nI have been successful with psychrometers so far, thanks to George’s lessons of almost 10 years ago. However, Ben shared a new method that limits xylem exposure, which likely increases the longevity of the installation. Using a flat razor blade, he makes initial transverse cuts spanning the diameter of the sensor head, which limits the width of the exposed xylem. After tangential cutting that exposes the different layers (outer bark, inner bark, phloem, cambium), Ben limits his motions to scraping, which minimizes over-cutting and ensures a flat surface for sensor attachment.\nIndeed, if the sensor loses contact with the xylem, the same installation site could be reused by re-scraping the xylem, rather than creating an additional wound elsewhere. I wish I’d known this method 3 years ago when working on sagebrush, which had highly irregular xylem!\nBut the information exchange was not unidirectional. George pioneered the use of self-adhesive silicone tape1 to attach the sensor to the stem, which provides both security and a vapor seal, replacing the need for vacuum grease. Ben still advises a minute application of vacuum grease, but he seemed excited to include silicone tape in future installation guidelines. It was a fantastic opportunity to learn by doing, while surrounded by the beauty of Northern Arizona."

    "section": "Origins",
    "text": "Origins\nThe PSInet idea represents a convergence of prior initiatives linked by their focus on network-enabled and/or global-scale understanding of ecosystem water status and flows. The first call from a water potential network may be traced to at 2012 American Geophysical Union presentation by PSInet Steering Committee member George Koch, which coincided with the publication of the first iteration of the Xylem Functional Traits (XFT) database. Since then, the SAPFLUXNET network was conceived and built, and flux tower networks have grown larger and become more open.\nThe last decade has seen an explosion of interest in using plant hydraulic concepts to address pressing eco-physiological research questions.However, a centralized repository for water potential time series, which are critical for connecting meteorological drivers to plant responses, does not yet exist. The need for such a database was again raised at the 2020 Ecological Society of America (ESA) meeting, where several team members (Guo, Novick, Kannenberg) convened the session “Plant Water Use Strategies in a Changing World.” The journal Functional Ecology invited the session organizers and speakers to prepare a review article on the topic which proposes that fully characterizing plant drought responses “require[s] water potential datasets of greater quantity and quality to pair with flux measurements, model output, and remote sensing approaches.”\nAt the same time, interest has been growing in the potential to use remotely-sensed vegetation optical depth data as a proxy for ecosystem water content and potential at continental and global scales. However, this research priority requires a centralized network of in-situ water potential observations for algorithm development and benchmarking. The emergence of psychrometers and other methodologies as tools for continuous monitoring of in-situ plant water potential has revealed a clear need for community-developed best practices and standards for deploying these instruments. Finally, there is a growing appreciation of the value of collecting, and aggregating, information on soil water potential (and its relationship with soil moisture content) in ecological field research settings, which is already being addressed to some extent by activities born out of the AmeriFlux “Year of Water” initiative (including the deployment of in-situ matric potential sensors at AmeriFlux sites, and a systematic effort to generate laboratory-derived water retention curves).\nWith support from this RCN, we can grow these individual efforts into a much larger global database that also includes continuous plant Ψ timeseries, and with links to data across multiple networks. This RCN will also provide diverse networking and training opportunities through collaborations with multiple established workshops and short-courses, including PhysFest, the Summer Workshop in Plant Hydraulic Techniques, and FluxCourse. Thus, our network design brings together many ongoing but thus-far disjunct and incomplete activities into a broader vision for a global plant water potential network and associated Community of Practice."

    "text": "Anticipating and preparing for life on a warming planet requires a predictive understanding of how increasing drought and heat stress will affect terrestrial plants and the many services they provide. The water potential of soils and plants – which can be imagined as the blood pressure of the natural world – is a fundamental driver of ecosystem water flows, and directly controls many aspects of plant functioning during drought. However, observations of water potential (commonly abbreviated with the Greek letter ‘Psi’, \\(\\Psi\\)) are relatively sparse, discontinuous, and unaggregated, and plagued by methodological challenges and disparities that constrain the synthetic research necessary to improve conceptual understanding and predictive models of plant drought responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Gradients in water potential (\\(\\Psi\\)) form a connected continuum, moving water through ecosystems and profoundly influencing plant function. PSInet will increase the quality and accessibility of data (in soils and plants, blue circles), filling a critical missing link between information about environmental drivers and physiological responses that is already widely available from existing networks and remote sensing platforms (pink text). Modified from Novick et al. 2022.\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to create a network – PSInet – that will confront the water potential information gap and enable the pursuit of previously intractable questions about plant responses to drought and heat stress. PSInet will be a network of data and a network of people, organized around coordinated research, training, and community-building activities designed to increase the availability, integrity, and accessibility of information to a diverse scientific community.\nSpecific objectives include:\n\nPromote consistent collection and interpretation of data by a diverse global community of scientists through shared protocols, best practices, and early career training.\nCreate an open, global database for plant and soil time series that is harmonized with information available from other environmental observation networks.\nSupport synthetic end-use of the PSInet database to address pressing knowledge gaps.\nFoster a diverse and inclusive network environment with multiple mechanisms to advance the careers of demographically, geographically, and intellectually diverse cohorts of early career scientists.\nBroaden the impact of plant drought research through public outreach activities organized around a network of “Talking Trees” at public gardens and arboreta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: PSInet project activities and timeline."

    "title": "Expanding soil water potential obervations using near-surface geophysics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Figure 1: ERI results from Panama highlighting the changes in soil water content based on soil conductance will be used to expand the spatial understanding of bulk and root-zone soil water potential. Data and figure credit Daniel Beverly\n\n\n\nMy Ph.D. at the University of Wyoming through the Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCHEG) afforded me a unique opportunity to mix hydrological, geophysical, and ecophysiological approaches to track water movement. Our extensive interdisciplinary team aimed to close the water budget using interpolations of snow distributions, measures of whole-tree and understory evapotranspiration, and a unique implementation of near-surface geophysical observations illuminating the subsurface hydrological fluxes. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) techniques have produced continuous observations of subsurface processes for parsing subsurface flows, vertical infiltration, and water uptake within the rooting zones. However, I believe this is just the forefront of using near-surface geophysical tools for exploring the rhizosphere and rooting-zone hydraulic mechanisms controlling carbon and water fluxes.\nThe world of plant water relations is theoretically rich with biophysical processes but often lacks empirical observations needed to test these mechanisms. A substantial gap emerges from the temporal and spatial mismatch in data collection of water potentials. Namely, leaf water potentials are typically measured once or twice a day (e.g., predawn and midday), at weekly to monthly sampling intervals, and on individuals distributed across the landscape. Soil water potential is rarely measured in situ; instead, estimates are predicted by models parameterized with soil volumetric water content and soil characteristics. Soil water contents are often recorded every 5 to 30 minutes, but only from a limited number of landscape positions. In sum, plant water potentials are mostly discrete in time but replicated spatially, while soil water potentials are mostly discrete in space but temporally continuous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The temporal-spatial mismatch across the water potential (Ψ) measurement space from soils (ΨS; light blue), xylem (ΨX; dark blue), and leaves (ΨL; green) limit confident predictions of Ψ gradients. The electrical resistivity imaging (ERI; burgundy) reduces this mismatch by expanding the spatial representation of ΨS to maximize the overlap with ΨL. Figure credit Daniel Beverly\n\n\n\nElectrical resistivity imaging (ERI) is a promising approach to fill gaps in the spatial-temporal mismatch for soil water potential measurements. Specifically, this technique expands spatial representation by covering more rooting and soil area while maintaining high temporal resolution. Repeated pulses of electrical current provide a time series of 2-D maps, capturing the subtle variations in soil, bedrock, and water content. Soil moisture can be confidently estimated as a function of electrical conductance.\nOur work in Panama was successful in differentiating the soil-surface evaporation and the depletion of soil moisture within the root zone. However, while ERI is typically used to monitor volumetric changes in soil water, it is rarely used to estimate the spatial-temporal dynamics of soil water potential. Since soil conductance and soil water potential are equally sensitive to changes in soil particle size, pH, salinity, cation exchange capacity, and porosity, ERI may be an even better proxy for soil water potential than water content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Electrodes associated with ERI transect running through a forest in southeastern Wyoming. Photo credit Daniel Beverly\n\n\n\nWith my newly funded USDA NIFA project, I am excited to explore the ability of the ERI techniques to characterize the rhizosphere and rooting zone soil water potentials. This project focuses on understanding the seasonal variation in rooting zone water potentials in hardwood forests of Indiana and Michigan, along with the evaluation of soil hydraulics differences among cover cropping strategies, both of which are important carbon sinks throughout the Midwest. We are hoping that these data will provide better constraints on the rooting processes that are doing to be essential for predicting future carbon sequestration and drought responses."

    "title": "How hot can leaves get?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "How hot is too hot? I often wonder this while watching my dog bask in the sun on a 110°F day here in Phoenix, AZ. This is perhaps an idle question about snoozing pups but also a serious one for plants that are rooted in place. At the Desert Botanical Garden, we deployed leaf thermistors on cottonwood saplings to understand how a foundation species can regulate their water for heat loss trade off.\nLeaf temperature can be tricky to measure in situ. The thermistor element is small and must be in constant contact with the leaf surface. However, the wires are also fragile and thin enough to snap in the wind if they are not installed correctly. Our team has devised a way to create and install leaf thermistors that can withstand the extremes of a Phoenix summer and monsoon storms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example of thermistor installation on a cottonwood leaf in at the Desert Botanical Garden.\n\n\n\nThe method involves attaching the thermistor head to the leaf using medical tape and avoiding major veins. As the leaf moves in the wind, it puts strain on the attachment wire; attaching the wire to follow the petiole is important so both can move in tandem. The thermistor element and its lead wire are soldered to Belden cable, and to keep the cable from straining the thermistor heads, we ziptied the cable to the trees as part of the overall cable management plan. Susan Bush masterminded the deployment of 36 thermistors on 12 trees, with help from Dan Koepke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: DBG researchers Susan Bush and Dan Koepke check on the leaf thermistor data under some shade.\n\n\n\nThe potted saplings were sourced from four populations spanning an elevation, and thus temperature, gradient. Initially watered regularly, trees were gradually subjected to drought in the record-breaking Phoenix heat. Preliminary leaf temperature data suggest that under well-watered conditions, trees from lower elevation (warmer) populations maintained leaf temperature well below air temperature relative to trees from higher elevation (cooler) populations Figure 3. In contrast, the pattern reversed when the trees were subjected to drought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Mean daytime leaf to air temperature difference over the course of the drought and recovery experiment for 3 individuals of Fremont cottonwood sourced from 4 populations.\n\n\n\nLeaf temperature methods can be used to supplement time series of sap flow or stem psychrometry to help us better understand leaf and whole-plant tradeoffs between limiting water loss and shedding heat through transpiration. The record heat in Phoenix makes the Desert Botanical Garden a compelling natural laboratory for what future climate will bring."
