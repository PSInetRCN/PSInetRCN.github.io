As we approach the close of the PSInet data submission period, we want to celebrate a few particularly noteworthy contributions to our database with some fun award categories. You can see the current leaderboards below. Congratulations to everyone who is pushing the boundaries of scientific discovery and collaboration!  

The definitive list of awardees will be announced after we close submissions on January 31st, 2025. Until then, we will continue to welcome your contributions and look forward to seeing if there are any late-breaking shakeups to these leaderboards!
