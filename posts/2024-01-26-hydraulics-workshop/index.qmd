# Overview

We're announcing the long-awaited return of the Plant Hydraulics Methods Workshop, organized by Dan Johnson and sponsored by PSInet. Potential topics include:

-   Sample collection, storage, and preparation
-   Leaf pressure-volume curves and measurement of leaf water potential
-   Measurements of hydraulic conductance and conductivity
-   Measurements of xylem vulnerability to embolism
-   Whole-tree water use: sap flow and eddy covariance methods
-   Active xylem staining
-   Optical dendrometry

## When and where?

The workshop will be held at the [Highlands Biological Station](https://highlandsbiological.org/) (HBS). All housing and catered lunches and dinners will be covered by the workshop funds and up to \$700 in travel reimbursement will be available to all attendees. There are full kitchens in each housing unit where attendees can make breakfast, coffee, etc. and there is a grocery store that is less than a ten minute walk from the station.
