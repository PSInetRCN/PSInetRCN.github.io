The seeds of this effort were planted at AGU in 2018, where Kim Novick and Jessica Guo bonded over their mutual determination to conference while parenting (thanks, Caregiver Award!) and shared interest in plant water potential. While both at University of Utah in 2020, Jessica and Steve Kannenberg invited Kim to moderate an ESA session on plant water potential, which resulted in a review paper ([Kannenberg, Guo, Novick et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13945)). 

Ultimately, Kim performed the heavy lifting of organizing a large steering committee and numerous moving parts to submit an Research Coordination Network proposal to NSF-IOS, twice. Now, the real work begins!
