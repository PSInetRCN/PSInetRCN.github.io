Anticipating and preparing for life on a warming planet requires a predictive understanding of how increasing drought and heat stress will affect terrestrial plants and the many services they provide. The water potential of soils and plants -- which can be imagined as the blood pressure of the natural world -- is a fundamental driver of ecosystem water flows, and directly controls many aspects of plant functioning during drought. However, observations of water potential (commonly abbreviated with the Greek letter 'Psi', $\Psi$) are relatively sparse, discontinuous, and unaggregated, and plagued by methodological challenges and disparities that constrain the synthetic research necessary to improve conceptual understanding and predictive models of plant drought responses.

![Gradients in water potential ($\Psi$) form a connected continuum, moving water through ecosystems and profoundly influencing plant function. PSInet will increase the quality and accessibility of data (in soils and plants, blue circles), filling a critical missing link between information about environmental drivers and physiological responses that is already widely available from existing networks and remote sensing platforms (pink text).

<b>Our goal is to create a network -- <i>PSInet</i> -- that will confront the water potential information gap and enable the pursuit of previously intractable questions about plant responses to drought and heat stress.</b> PSInet will be a network of data and a network of people, organized around coordinated research, training, and community-building activities designed to increase the availability, integrity, and accessibility of information to a diverse scientific community.

Specific objectives include:

1.  <b>Promote</b> consistent collection and interpretation of data by a diverse global community of scientists through shared protocols, best practices, and early career training.

2.  <b>Create</b> an open, global database for plant and soil time series that is harmonized with information available from other environmental observation networks.

3.  <b>Support</b> synthetic end-use of the PSInet database to address pressing knowledge gaps.

4.  <b>Foster</b> a diverse and inclusive network environment with multiple mechanisms to advance the careers of demographically, geographically, and intellectually diverse cohorts of early career scientists.

5.  <b>Broaden</b> the impact of plant drought research through public outreach activities organized around a network of "Talking Trees" at public gardens and arboreta.
